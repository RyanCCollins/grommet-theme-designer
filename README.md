## Reference

### Saving

Your latest theme edits are saved in your browser's local storage. So,
you can refresh your window without fear of losing anything. But, if you
clear your local storage, you'll lose whatever you've done.

If you change the name of a theme, it will create a new theme with that name.
The control in the top left let's you browse your themes, create a new one,
or import a theme file you've exported.

### Sharing

The Share control near the upper left provides two methods of sharing.

1. Publish your theme. This will generate a unique URL you can send
to someone. When they open that URL, they will see your work. They will not be
able to modify it.
1. Download the theme as a JSON file. You can save or send this
however you like. You can upload one of these files using the Folder control
dialog, via the Upload control at the bottom.
